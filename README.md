# Ethereum SGX Signer PoC

## üõ°Ô∏è Objective

Build a secure Ethereum signer that runs inside an Intel SGX enclave to protect the private key from the host OS. The enclave:

- Stores the ECDSA private key internally.
- Signs Ethereum messages and transactions without ever exposing the key.
- Exposes a minimal API (later via CLI and optionally REST).

> We aim for compatibility with Ethereum tooling (e.g., `web3.py`, `eth_account`) by returning `(r, s, v)` and enforcing EIP-2 (low `s` value).

## ‚úÖ Step 1: Confirm SGX Support and Environment Setup

### Hardware

We verified SGX support using the `test-sgx` tool:

- ‚úÖ SGX1 is supported
- ‚ùå SGX2 is not available (not required for our case)
- ‚úÖ EPC is present and allocated
- ‚úÖ BIOS setting `Software Guard Extensions` is **Enabled**
- ‚úÖ `/dev/isgx` exists after loading the kernel module

### Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies
sudo apt install dkms build-essential
git clone https://github.com/intel/linux-sgx-driver.git
cd linux-sgx-driver
make
sudo make install
```

```bash
# Check SGX device
ls -al /dev/isgx
```

> If `/dev/isgx` is missing, load the module manually:

```bash
sudo modprobe isgx
```

## ‚úÖ Step 2: Build and Run the Intel SGX SDK Sample Project (`SampleEnclave`)

### Objective
Verify that Intel SGX SDK and driver are working correctly by building and running the official `SampleEnclave` application.

### Instructions

1. **Install SGX SDK (Ubuntu 20.04/22.04)**

    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install -y build-essential ocaml automake autoconf libtool wget python3
    wget https://download.01.org/intel-sgx/sgx-linux/2.19/distro/ubuntu22.04-server/sgx_linux_x64_sdk_2.19.100.3.bin
    chmod +x sgx_linux_x64_sdk_2.19.100.3.bin
    ./sgx_linux_x64_sdk_2.19.100.3.bin
    ```

    > üìå When prompted, choose a directory like `$HOME/sgxsdk` and allow installation.

2. **Source the SDK environment**

    ```bash
    source ~/sgxsdk/environment
    ```

3. **Clone the Intel SGX SDK samples and build them**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/intel/linux-sgx.git
    cd linux-sgx/SampleCode/SampleEnclave
    make
    ```

4. **Run the enclave app**

    ```bash
    ./app
    ```

    > You should see output confirming successful interaction with the SGX enclave.

5. **Alternative build**
```

```

## Overview

This repository documents the step-by-step process of enabling Intel SGX on a workstation and testing both the Intel SGX SDK and Gramine (formerly Graphene) as potential environments for secure enclaves.

## ‚úÖ Current Working Configuration (SGX SDK)

| Component             | Status      | Notes                                |
|----------------------|-------------|--------------------------------------|
| Intel SGX SDK        | ‚úÖ Working   | `isgx` kernel driver is loaded       |
| SampleEnclave (SDK)  | ‚úÖ Working   | Runs in both `SIM` and `HW` modes    |
| LocalAttestation     | ‚úÖ Working   | Secure session established           |
| Gramine in direct mode (`gramine-direct`) | ‚úÖ Working   | But only outside SGX (`SGX=SIM` not fully working) |

---

## ‚ùå Gramine (intel_sgx driver)

| Component             | Status      | Notes                                                             |
|----------------------|-------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Gramine SGX mode     | ‚ùå Not working | Fails due to missing `/dev/sgx/enclave` device                    |
| intel_sgx kernel module | ‚ùå Not installed | Ubuntu kernel does not ship it by default; requires DKMS or new kernel |
| Switching driver     | ‚ö†Ô∏è Complicated | Involves removing `isgx`, breaking AESM support, rebooting        |

---

## üìå Decision

For practical development and minimal disruption to the working SGX SDK setup:

**We will continue using the Intel SGX SDK (`isgx` driver)**

### Reasoning:
- SDK works reliably with existing examples.
- No need to patch the kernel or modify boot parameters.
- Gramine requires `intel_sgx` and is not compatible with `isgx`.

---

## Next Steps

We will now explore:
- Running a Python script from within the SGX enclave using the SDK (`system()` or `popen()`).
- Passing signed or encrypted data between the Python side and the enclave.
- Building minimal ECALL/OCALL interface for secure data exchange.
