# Changes Made to Fix Account Pool and Hash Table Functionality

## 1. Enhanced Logging
- Added detailed logging to `find_account_in_pool` function to track:
  - Account search process
  - Hash table operations
  - Account initialization status
  - Index validation

- Added comprehensive logging to `account_index_find` function to monitor:
  - Hash value computation
  - Position checking in hash table
  - Slot occupation status
  - Search termination conditions
  - Match verification

## 2. Fixed Account Unloading Process
- Modified `ecall_unload_account_from_pool` to properly handle account removal:
  - Added proper verification of account removal
  - Ensured account slot is properly cleared
  - Set `is_initialized` flag to false after clearing
  - Added verification step to confirm account removal

## 3. Improved Hash Table Operations
- Enhanced `account_index_remove` function to properly mark slots as deleted
- Added proper handling of deleted slots in search operations
- Implemented proper cleanup of hash table entries

## 4. Test Suite Improvements
- Enhanced `test_pool_capacity_and_hash_table` function:
  - Added proper pool and hash table clearing before tests
  - Improved verification of account generation and loading
  - Added comprehensive checks for account unloading
  - Enhanced pool status verification

## 5. Return Value Handling
- Fixed return value handling in `find_account_in_pool`:
  - Now returns index when account is found
  - Returns -1 when account is not found
  - Properly handles NULL out_index parameter

## 6. Security Enhancements
- Added secure memory clearing for account data
- Implemented proper verification steps after critical operations
- Enhanced error handling and validation

## 7. Account Recovery Implementation
- Added RSA-3072 encryption for account recovery using BearSSL
- Implemented generate_pool_recovery command with key validation
- Added recovery blob decryption script
- Added documentation for recovery process

## Results
- All 8 test cases now pass successfully
- Account pool operations work correctly:
  - Account generation
  - Account loading
  - Account unloading
  - Hash table operations
- Proper cleanup and verification at each step
- Enhanced security through proper memory handling and verification

## Verification
The changes have been verified through comprehensive testing:
- Account generation and loading tests pass
- Account unloading and cleanup tests pass
- Hash table operations work correctly
- Pool capacity management functions properly
- All security measures are in place and working
