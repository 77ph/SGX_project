## Notes

- All stub functions print a warning message when called
- These functions are maintained for backward compatibility with Enclave.edl
- Future cleanup may involve removing these functions from Enclave.edl
- Current active alternatives:
  - Account management: Use ecall_generate_account, ecall_save_account, ecall_load_account
  - Signing: Use ecall_sign_transaction or ecall_sign_message
  - Testing: Use ecall_test_save_load and ecall_test_sign_verify
